title: What PDC is
---

PDC is the unit of account on this chain. The ticker in the source is `PDC`. Amounts use 12 decimal places, so one PDC is `1000000000000` atomic units. The constant is named `COIN`.

There is no premine. `PREMINE_AMOUNT` is 0, and the genesis block reward uses that value. From the next block onward, the base block reward is 1 PDC. The reward does not decay with height. A block that grows past the median size earns less, and a block larger than twice the median is rejected. The full-reward zone is 125,000 bytes.

## Consensus in one paragraph

Proof of work and proof of stake run together from the first blocks. Each side targets 120 seconds. The combined target is 60 seconds, so a healthy chain produces about 1,440 blocks a day and about 525,600 PDC a year. Proof of work is RandomARQ. Proof of stake starts at height 0. After height 100, hard fork 4 replaces the stake proof with Zarcanum, which keeps the staked amount sealed.

## What a normal transfer hides

A wallet transfer does not publish the four fields people usually read off a block explorer:

- The receiver is a one-time stealth output, not the published `Px` address.
- The sender is hidden in a d/v-CLSAG ring. The default decoy set has 10 members. After hard fork 4 the mandatory size is 15.
- The amount sits in a commitment. Bulletproofs+ (the `bpp` proofs in `src/crypto/range_proof_bpp.h`) show that the transaction balances without printing the number.
- The asset id is blinded, so native PDC and a user token look the same on a wallet transfer.

Issuing, minting, and burning a token are separate, explicit operations. An alias registration is also explicit: the name is public, and the fee is burned.
