# PDC documentation

English manual for Privacy Data Coin. The section order follows a full-chain manual: learn the protocol, use a wallet, build and integrate, mine, stake, and read the source. The colors, the logo, and the facts are PDC.

Protocol numbers come from the PDC source, especially `src/currency_core/currency_config.h`. The edition number and the install files follow the latest GitHub release of [PrivacyDataCoin-Project/pdc](https://github.com/PrivacyDataCoin-Project/pdc). The published manual reads that release on each page load. The release current at the time of this writing is [v2.2.0](https://github.com/PrivacyDataCoin-Project/pdc/releases/tag/v2.2.0) (30 September 2026).
